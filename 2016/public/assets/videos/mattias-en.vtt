Hello, my name is MPJ.

2
00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.550
My full name is Mattias Petter Johansson.

3
00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:12.050
But let's face it, you have as much chance on pronoucing that correctly as I have pronouncing "meal" in Portuguese.

4
00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:13.800
Efeiciauuuu (He tried to say "refeição")

5
00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:21.050
I live in Sweden, wich is a country that is basically the opposite of Brazil:
It's small, cold and introverted.

6
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:28.000
Some of you might know me because during the weekends I produce an Youtube show, called "FunFunFunction".

7
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:33.650
During the week I work at Spotify, as a JavaScript developer on the desktop client,

8
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.000
wich is one of the most advanced JavaScript applications in the world.

9
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.700
I'm very excited to be speaking at BrazilJS,

10
00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:47.550
because BrazilJS is the biggest JavaScript conference in the world.

11
00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.250
And this is my biggest speaking engagement ever.

12
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.900
The audience is going to be huge!

13
00:00:53.050 --> 00:01:01.050
So, either you'll have the experience on watching an internet celebrity, as myself, die on the stage from a heart attack.

14
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:08.200
Or, I'll live through the talk, and you'll learn some very interesting things about functional programming in JavaScript.

15
00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.150
I very much hope that you'll come to BrazilJS and see my talk.

16
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.800
And should I survive, please grab me during the conference and have a chat about JavaScript.

17
00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.150
Come to BrazilJS!

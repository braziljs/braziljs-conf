Hey BrazilJS Folks!

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:04.480
Hi, my name is SÃ©rgio Lopes

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.880
I am an instructor and developer
at Alura and Caelum

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:10.760
where I work mainly with Front End

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.160
mobile, optimization,
performance

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.200
and things like that

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.480
I want to invite you to
BrazilJS, this year!

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.460

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.580
Which is happening in August,

But there will also be a lot of
interesting people in this event!

A lot of amazing things! I was looking
at the website now

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.900
and the amount of impressive talks
that will happen there

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.480

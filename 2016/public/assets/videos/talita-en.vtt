Hi everybody

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:07.240
My name is Talita Pagani
Many of you know me for

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.460
the articles I write for Tableless
and I am also

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.620
a bit entusiast of Web Accessibility

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.460
which is exactly the subject of my talk

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.460
at BrazilJS 2016!

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.440
I am a Front End Developer
hybrid with I Design Interfae

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.060
working in the field for 10 year.

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:31.040
I am from BaurÃº, the Brazilian Springfield!
It is in Sau Paulo's Countryside.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.940
and is always present in
the conference

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.140
But now I live in Sao Paulo
(in the capital)

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.620
working as web designer and
front-end developer at Red Ventures

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.480
and I will talk to you about web accessibility
for autistic people

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.740
Which is the subject of my
Master Degree Project

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:54.280
which I hope I will have presented by the
time of the conference!

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.700
And this is a very interesting subject.
I think few developers really

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.640
know how to make their websites and
applications accessible

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.160
for this audience.
I want to present to you

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:10.960
something that will change the way
you think and work

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.580
related to web accessibility

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.100
I want to show some very innovative contents and...

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.680
show you what some developer's
roles and how

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:27.520
with a few changes, we can improve
and use and experience in

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.230
our websites and applications
for a much more varied audience

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:35.860
not only for people with visual impairment,
but with different characteristics

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.460
This is my third BrazilJS

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.230
the first as a Speaker

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.900
This is a big responsibility,
and the biggest conference

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.900
I will be speaking at, up to now

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.030
I will be waiting you all, there
In Porto Alegre, in August

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.100
to learn a bit more about web accessibility

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:00.430
and make this beautiful internet of ours,
yet more inclusive

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.760
I hope I see you there,
feel invited

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.760
don't hesitate to subscribe to the conference!
It is a great event!

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.400
I recomend it a lot!

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.400
and...may the force be with you!

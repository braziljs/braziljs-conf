Hello, I'm Jake Archibald.
I'm a developer advocate for Google Chrome.

2
00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:10.550
And I'm delighted to tell you about an exciting event taking place in Brazil in August.

3
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.300
That's right, the Olympics.

4
00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:16.150
Which features people who are the best in the world throwing things,

5
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.800
sometimes themselves

6
00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.050
Kicking things, sometimes each other

7
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.000
And travelling really fast, sometimes on top of a bike,

8
00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.650
or sometimes, a horse.

9
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:34.000
But after all, let's over. On the 26 and 27 of August is BrazilJS Conf in Porto Alegre.

10
00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.350
I'm gonna be there, along with a bunch of people much smarter than me,

11
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.600
And I'll be talking about the future of Web performance.

12
00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.050
And what is that involved? Well, you have to join me and find out.

13
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.000
I mean, I haven't written yet, so I really have no idea.
